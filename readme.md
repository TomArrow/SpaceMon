# SpaceMon

Windows Tool to draw a space usage overlay on the screen to avoid data loss from drives running out of space (C#/WPF) 

The following screenshot shows the look of the overlay at 400% size (screenshot from WPF designer).

When the .exe launches, drag the graphic overlay where you want it. Once you release the mouse drag, the position becomes fixed and the program no longer captures your mouse, allowing you to work freely with anything underneath.

If you need to reposition, either close and reopen the program or click on the icon in the taskbar and press Alt+O, allowing you to drag it again.
